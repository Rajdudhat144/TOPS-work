Mobile Application?

                A mobile application (or mobile app) is a software application designed to run on a smartphone or tablet. 

What are the differences between native and hybrid mobile apps?

                When deciding between native and hybrid mobile app development, it's essential to understand their key differences, including how they are built, their performance, user experience, and development costs.

     1. Definition
      
        Native Mobile Apps:
                Native apps are developed specifically for a single platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific programming languages and development tools.
                iOS apps are typically developed in Swift or Objective-C.
                Android apps are developed in Java or Kotlin.
                These apps are designed to run directly on the device, providing full access to device-specific features (camera, GPS, etc.).

        Hybrid Mobile Apps:
                Hybrid apps are developed using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they are wrapped in a native container (via frameworks like Cordova, Ionic, or React Native) to allow them to run on multiple platforms.
                The same codebase can be deployed to both iOS and Android, reducing development time.

    2. Platform Compatibility

        Native Apps:
                Native apps are built for one platform at a time, meaning a separate app needs to be created for iOS and Android.
                Different codebases are required for each platform, leading to longer development cycles and increased cost.

        Hybrid Apps:
                Hybrid apps can run on multiple platforms with the same codebase, allowing developers to write the app once and deploy it to both iOS and Android.
                This cross-platform compatibility reduces development time and cost.

    3. Development Time and Cost

        Native Apps:
                Longer development time because developers need to create separate apps for different platforms (iOS and Android).
                Higher costs due to the need for distinct development teams or additional resources to maintain multiple codebases.

        Hybrid Apps:
                Faster development because a single codebase is used for both iOS and Android, allowing the app to be developed more quickly.
                Lower development cost compared to native apps, as only one set of developers and a single codebase is required.
