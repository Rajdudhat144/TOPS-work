Maintenance?
    
        Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software after it has been deployed to ensure that it continues to perform as expected and remains useful and relevant over time.

What types of software maintenance are there?

        There are four primary types of software maintenance, each focused on different aspects of keeping a software system functional, reliable, and aligned with business or user needs. These types are:

                1. Corrective Maintenance:

                        Definition:

                            Involves fixing defects or issues in the software that were identified after the software has been deployed.

                        Objective:

                            Correct any errors, bugs, or malfunctions in the software that impact its intended functionality.

                        Examples:
                
                            Resolving crashes or system failures.

                            Fixing security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

                            Patching issues that were missed during the initial development or testing phase.

                        When It Happens:

                                Typically after the software has been released and users report issues or defects.

                2. Adaptive Maintenance:

                            Definition:

                                Focuses on updating and modifying the software to ensure it remains compatible with the changing environment, such as updates to operating systems, hardware, or other software components.

                            Objective:

                                Adapt the software to external changes in the environment, ensuring continued compatibility and functionality.

                            Examples:

                                Updating software to be compatible with a new version of the operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux).

                                Modifying the software to integrate with updated third-party services or APIs.
                                    
                                Making changes to the software due to new hardware configurations or devices.

                            When It Happens:

                                When there are changes in external factors that affect the software's operation.
