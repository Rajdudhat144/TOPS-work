What is Programming?

            Programming is the process of writing, testing, and maintaining the code that makes a computer or software 
            perform specific tasks. It involves creating instructions that a computer can understand and execute to solve
            a problem,  automate a task, or create software applications.
          
 What are the key steps involved in the programming process?Types of Programming Languages?

     Key Steps in the Programming Process:

            The programming process typically follows a series of steps that guide developers from understanding the problem to creating a solution that works. These steps include:

     Problem Definition/Requirement Analysis:

            Understanding the problem or task at hand.
            Gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders or users.
            Clearly defining the input, output, and constraints of the system.

     Algorithm Design:

            Designing a step-by-step procedure (algorithm) to solve the problem.
            This step involves breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
            The algorithm should be efficient, clear, and correct.

     Choosing the Programming Language:

            Based on the requirements and constraints, select an appropriate programming language for the task.
            Factors include performance needs, platform constraints, and the specific features needed (e.g., support for GUI, web development, scientific computing).
          
      Coding/Implementation:

            Writing the code to implement the algorithm.
            Translating the algorithm into the chosen programming language using its syntax and constructs.
            Developers follow best practices for readability, maintainability, and efficiency during this phase.
      Testing:

            Testing the code to ensure it behaves as expected.

      Debugging:

            Identifying, isolating, and fixing errors or bugs in the code.

      Optimization:

            Optimization is typically done only after correctness is ensured.
   
     Documentation:

            Writing clear and comprehensive documentation to explain the code, algorithms, and any assumptions made.
   
     Deployment/Release:

            Deploying the code to the production environment where users can interact with it.
 
     Maintenance:

            Maintenance ensures the program remains useful and functional over time.

    Types of Programming Languages:

     1. Low-Level Languages:

        Machine Language:
                The lowest level of programming language, consisting of binary code (1s and 0s) that the computer's CPU understands directly.
                Each machine language is specific to the computer architecture.

        Assembly Language:
                A human-readable representation of machine language using mnemonics (e.g., MOV, ADD).
                It is still hardware-dependent but easier to understand than pure binary code.
                Requires an assembler to translate into machine language.

    2. High-Level Languages:

            Procedural Programming Languages:

                Focuses on a sequence of steps (procedures or functions) to be executed.
                Examples: C, Pascal, Fortran.

            Object-Oriented Programming Languages:

                Organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes, encapsulating both data and behavior.
                Promotes code reuse and modularity.
                Examples: Java, C++, Python, Ruby.

            Functional Programming Languages:

                Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data.
                Focuses on immutability and first-class functions.
                Examples: Haskell, Lisp, Erlang.
