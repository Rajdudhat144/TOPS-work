Software Development Process?

            The Software Development Process refers to the structured approach and set of steps followed by developers to design, build, test, and maintain software applications or systems. This process involves various stages and methodologies to ensure the final product meets user requirements, is of high quality, and can be maintained and updated efficiently.


 What are the main stages of the software development process?
 
            The software development process typically involves several key stages, each focusing on different aspects of building a software application. The main stages are as follows:

                    1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis:

                        Objective:

                            Understand what the software needs to achieve and gather all the necessary information.


                          Activities:

                            Identify stakeholders (e.g., users, clients, or business owners).

                            Collect requirements through meetings, surveys, or document analysis.
    
                            Define functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (performance, security, etc.) requirements.


                    2. System Design:

                         Objective:

                            Plan the structure and architecture of the software.

                        Activities:

                            Design the overall system architecture, including databases, networks, and user interfaces.

                            Define high-level (system-wide) and low-level (individual modules) design.

                    3. Implementation (Coding):

                        Objective:

                            Translate the design into actual code.

                        Activities:

                            Developers write the code according to the specifications and design documents.

                            Follow best practices for coding standards, modularity, and maintainability.

                    4. Testing:

                        Objective:

                            Ensure the software works as expected, is free of bugs, and meets the requirements.

                        Activities:


                        Unit Testing:


                            Test individual components or functions of the code.

                        Integration Testing:

                            Ensure different parts of the system work together properly.

                        System Testing:

                            Test the complete software in the environment where it will be used.
