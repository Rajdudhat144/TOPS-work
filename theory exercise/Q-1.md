1] What is a Program?

        A program is a set of instructions or code written in a programming language that a computer can execute to perform a 
        specific task or set of tasks.
    

 Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions?

  

        A program is essentially a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Think of it like a recipe in a 
        cookbook,where the recipe gives step-by-step guidance on how to make a dish. 

    How a Program Functions:
    
        Writing the Code: A programmer writes a program using a programming language (like Python, Java, or C++). These 
        languages have specific rules (syntax) for writing instructions that a computer can follow.

    Execution:

         Once the program is written, it needs to be translated into machine code that the computer can understand. This
          is usually done by either:

        Compiling (turning the whole program into machine code before running it) or
        Interpreting (translating the program into machine code line by line while it runs).

    Processing the Instructions: 
        
        The computer's processor (CPU) reads and follows these instructions one by one. It might perform simple operations,
        like adding two numbers, or complex ones, like running a game with graphics and sound.

    Output: 

        After processing the instructions, the program usually provides some form of output. This could be:

        Displaying text or images on the screen,
        Saving a file, or
        Interacting with other software or hardware (e.g., sending data over the internet).

    Repetition and Automation:

        Many programs are designed to run continuously or repeatedly, performing tasks without human intervention. For 
        example, a program might check for new emails every minute or constantly adjust settings in a video game.
