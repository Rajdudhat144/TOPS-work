Types of Internet Connections?

                Internet connections can vary in    , availability, reliability, and technology used. 

How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?

                Broadband and fiber-optic internet are related but distinct terms in the world of internet connectivity. 

        1. Definition:
                       
        Broadband:
                Broadband is a general term used to describe high-speed internet connections that offer faster speeds than traditional dial-up. Broadband can refer to any internet connection that provides high-speed access to the internet, typically defined as speeds greater than 256 kbps (kilobits per second).

        Fiber-Optic Internet:
                Fiber-optic internet is a specific type of broadband connection that uses fiber-optic cables (made of glass or plastic) to transmit data using light signals. This is one of the fastest and most reliable types of broadband internet.
        
        2. Technology Used:
      
        Broadband:
                Broadband is a broad category and includes several types of internet technologies

        Fiber-Optic Internet:
                Fiber-optic technology uses glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as light signals. Because light can travel at much higher speeds than electrical signals (used by traditional copper or coaxial cables), fiber-optic connections can achieve much higher speeds and lower latency.


    Summary of Key Differences:

Feature	            Broadband	                          Fiber-Optic Internet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition      	A general term for high-speed internet.	                A specific type of broadband using 
                                                                                 fiber-optic cables.
Speed           	Varies by technology (1 Mbps to 1 Gbps).	            Very high speed (100 Mbps to 10 Gbps                
Technology      	Includes DSL, cable, satellite, fiber, etc.        	    Uses fiber-optic cables (light signals).
Latency	            Depends on the technology.	                            Very low latency (ideal for gaming, streaming).
Reliability     	Varies; can be less reliable with DSL or satellite. 	Highly reliable and stable.
Availability    	Widely available in urban and rural areas.	            Limited availability, mainly in urban areas.
Cost	            Varies; DSL and cable are cheaper.	                    Generally more expensive than other broadband types.
Use Case	        General use, streaming, browsing, gaming.              	High-bandwidth tasks (gaming, streaming, business).
