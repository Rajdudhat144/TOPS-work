 Protocols?
        
        protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers.


What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols?
        
         The primary difference between HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) lies in security. Here are the main differences:

        1. Security:
            HTTP: 
            
                This is an unsecured protocol. Data transferred between your browser and the website server is not encrypted, meaning it's vulnerable to interception (e.g., by hackers or malicious third parties).
            
            HTTPS:
            
                This is a secured version of HTTP. It uses encryption protocols such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data exchanged between the browser and the server, making it much harder for third parties to intercept or tamper with the communication.
        
        2. Encryption:
                
                HTTP: 
                
                    Does not encrypt data. Any information, including sensitive details like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data, is sent in plain text.
                
                HTTPS:
                
                    Encrypts the data using SSL/TLS, which ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it is unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the proper decryption key.

        3. Port Numbers:
                
                HTTP:
                     
                     Uses port 80 for communication.
                
                HTTPS:
                 
                    Uses port 443 for secure communication.
