Desktop Application?

                A Desktop Application is a type of software that is designed to run on a desktop or laptop computer, as opposed to being accessed through a web browser. 

What are the pros and cons of desktop applications compared to web applications?

                When deciding between desktop applications and web applications, it's essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each based on factors like performance, accessibility, cost, maintenance, and security. 

    Pros of Desktop Applications
            
        Performance
            Faster Execution:
                Desktop applications typically run faster because they are installed locally on the user's machine and have direct access to system resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.), which often results in better performance compared to web applications, which rely on a browser and internet connection.
            Resource-Intensive Tasks:
                They can handle resource-heavy tasks such as 3D rendering, video editing, and complex computations without being limited by network speed or server capacity.

    Cons of Desktop Applications

        Platform Dependency
            Limited Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
                Desktop applications are often developed for specific operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). This means they need to be re-developed or ported to work on different platforms, leading to increased development and maintenance costs.
            Fragmentation:
                Even within a single OS, differences in versions (e.g., Windows 10 vs. Windows 11) may cause compatibility issues.

     Cons of Web Applications

        Dependence on Internet Connectivity
            Requires an Internet Connection: 
                Web apps rely on a stable internet connection to work. If the user is in an area with poor internet connectivity, the application may become slow or completely unavailable.
            Latency Issues: 
                The performance of web applications can suffer from latency issues, especially if the application has to communicate with a distant server.
