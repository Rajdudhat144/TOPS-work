Software Testing?

        Software Testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that involves the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements and works as expected.

Why is software testing important?
            
        Software testing is crucial in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the final product is reliable, functional, and meets the specified requirements. Here are the key reasons why software testing is important:

            1. Ensures Quality of the Product:

                        Software testing ensures that the system functions as intended and meets the quality standards. It helps verify that all the features work correctly, and the software is free of defects that could impact its usability, functionality, or performance.
            
            2. Identifies Bugs Early:
                    
                        Testing helps identify and fix defects (bugs) early in the development process. Early bug detection is critical because the cost and effort to fix bugs grow exponentially as development progresses. By catching bugs early, developers can resolve issues before they escalate.

            3. Prevents Failures in Production:

                        Software that is not properly tested is likely to have issues when deployed to the production environment, which can lead to system crashes, downtime, or security vulnerabilities. Testing ensures that the software is stable and operates without failure when in use, preventing costly disruptions.
