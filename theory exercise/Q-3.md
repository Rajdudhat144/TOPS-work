 What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programming languages?

        The primary differences between high-level and low-level programming languages lie in their abstraction from hardware, ease of use, and the level of control they provide over the computer’s hardware.

        1. Abstraction Level

                Low-Level Languages:
                        Low-level languages are closer to machine code (binary). They are directly understood by the computer's hardware with minimal abstraction.
                        They operate at a level that represents the architecture and instructions of the computer's CPU.
                        Examples: Machine Language, Assembly Language.

                High-Level Languages:
                        High-level languages provide a higher degree of abstraction from the hardware.
                        They allow programmers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with the intricacies of hardware or memory management.
                        These languages are more human-readable and are designed to be easier to use, with less concern for the underlying hardware.
                        Examples: Python, Java, C++, Ruby, JavaScript.
        2. Ease of Use

                Low-Level Languages:
                        Harder to learn and use because they require the programmer to manage memory manually and deal with processor-specific details.
                        The programmer needs to understand the underlying hardware, registers, memory addresses, and instructions to write even simple programs.

                High-Level Languages:
                        Easier to learn and use, as they provide a more abstracted, user-friendly syntax and a variety of built-in features (like garbage collection, high-level data types, libraries, etc.).
                        They allow programmers to write complex programs with less effort and fewer lines of code.
        3. Control Over Hardware

                Low-Level Languages:
                        Provide more control over the hardware because they allow direct access to memory and processor instructions.
                        Developers can optimize for performance and have fine-grained control over resource management, such as memory allocation and deallocation.
                High-Level Languages:
                        Provide less control over hardware, as they abstract away memory management and low-level operations.
                        Most of the hardware management is handled by the language runtime or the operating system (e.g., memory management, input/output operations).
        4. Execution Speed

                Low-Level Languages:
                        Programs written in low-level languages are generally faster and more efficient in terms of resource usage because they interact directly with the hardware.
                        They can be optimized to take full advantage of the hardware’s capabilities, leading to better performance, especially for tasks that require high-speed computations.
                High-Level Languages:
                        Programs in high-level languages may be slower because they are often interpreted or compiled into an intermediate code, which introduces overhead.
                        However, modern compilers and just-in-time (JIT) compilers have significantly reduced the performance gap in many cases.
        5. Portability

                Low-Level Languages:
                        Low-level languages are typically platform-specific. Programs written in assembly language or machine language are often tailored to a specific computer architecture (e.g., Intel x86 or ARM).
                        This makes them less portable across different systems unless the program is rewritten or recompiled for each system.
                High-Level Languages:
                        High-level languages are generally platform-independent. Programs written in high-level languages can run on different operating systems or hardware platforms with minimal modification (thanks to interpreters or cross-platform compilers).
                        Examples: Java programs can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Python can be run on different platforms without modification.
