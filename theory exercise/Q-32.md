Flow Chart?

                A Flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of a process, algorithm, or workflow. It uses various symbols and arrows to depict the steps, decisions, and flow of data or operations within a system or process.

How do flowcharts help in programming and system design?

                Flowcharts play a critical role in the programming and system design phases of software development.

        1. Visualizing the Logic of a Program
                Flowcharts provide a visual representation of how a program works by illustrating the sequence of steps involved in processing data. By creating flowcharts for algorithms, developers can ensure that the logic is clear and that all necessary steps are considered.

        2. Simplifying Complex Algorithms
                Some algorithms can be difficult to understand when described in textual form. A flowchart breaks the logic into simple, easy-to-follow steps, making complex processes more digestible for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.
        
        3. Identifying Potential Errors Early
                By mapping out the flow of a program, flowcharts can help in identifying logical errors, missing steps, or areas where the flow is unclear. This can help in preventing issues before actual coding begins.

        4. Improving Code Efficiency
                Flowcharts can help optimize code by revealing unnecessary steps, redundant calculations, or inefficiencies in the algorithm design.

        5. Facilitating Collaboration and Communication
                Flowcharts help teams communicate complex logic and system designs clearly and concisely. They are especially useful in collaborative settings where stakeholders (such as developers, project managers, and non-technical users) need to be on the same page.
