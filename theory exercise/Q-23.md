System Design?

        System Design is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that focuses on creating the architecture and components of a software system.

What are the key elements of system design?

        The key elements of system design serve as the building blocks for creating a software system that is functional, efficient, scalable, secure, and maintainable. These elements define the architecture and components of the system, providing the blueprint for development, testing, and deployment. Here are the key elements of system design:

                1. System Architecture:

                        Definition:

                            System architecture is the high-level structure of the software system. It defines how the system is organized, including its components, their interactions, and how they communicate with each other.

                        Types of Architecture:



                                Monolithic Architecture:

                                        The entire system is built as a single, tightly coupled unit.

                                Microservices Architecture:

                                        The system is broken down into smaller, loosely coupled services, each responsible for specific functionalities.

                                Client-Server Architecture:

                                        The system is divided into a client (front-end) and server (back-end), where the client requests services from the server.

                                Layered Architecture:

                                        The system is divided into different layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access, each responsible for a specific task.

                    2. Module Design:

                                Definition:

                                        Modules are smaller, independent components of a system that are responsible for specific functionalities. Good module design ensures that each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

                                Key Aspects:


                                        Modularity:

                                            Dividing the system into distinct, manageable components or modules.

                                        Cohesion:

                                            Ensuring that each module has a clear, focused responsibility and that its components are closely related.

                                        Loose Coupling:

                                             Ensuring that modules are independent of each other, making it easier to modify one without affecting others.
