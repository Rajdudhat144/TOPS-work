World Wide Web & How Internet Works?

                While the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) are terms that are often used interchangeably, they are distinct concepts

Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication.Network Layers on Client and Server?

                In web communication, the roles of the client and server are essential for enabling the interaction and data exchange between users and websites or web applications

    1. Role of the Client in Web Communication

                The client is typically the end-user device (such as a browser or mobile application) that initiates the request for resources hosted on a server.

        Key Responsibilities of the Client:
                Initiates Requests: The client sends requests to the server for resources like web pages, images, videos, or data (typically using HTTP or HTTPS).

        User Interface (UI):
                The client provides the interface for user interaction. This includes displaying content and accepting input (e.g., clicks, form submissions).

    2. Role of the Server in Web Communication

                The server is the machine or service that hosts resources or applications, processes requests from clients, and responds with the requested content.

        Key Responsibilities of the Server:
                Hosts Resources: The server stores web pages, media files, databases, and other resources that clients request (e.g., HTML files, images, videos).
                Processes Requests: When a client sends an HTTP request, the server processes that request, finds the required resource, and returns a response (usually as an HTML page, API data, etc.).

    3. Network Layers in Client-Server Communication

                The communication between the client and server follows a structured approach across different network layers, where each layer has specific responsibilities.

    4. Client-Server Communication:  A Step-by-Step Overview
   
                Here’s a simple example of how a client and server interact in a typical web communication scenario:

        Client Request:

                The browseThe client (browser) types a URL (e.g., http://www.example.com) and sends an HTTP GET request to the server.
                r converts the domain name to an IP address using DNS.
                
        Transport Layer:

                The client’s computer sends the request over the network using TCP to establish a connection with the server (on port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS).
