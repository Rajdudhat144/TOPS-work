Network Layers on Client and Server?

            In networking, the client and server are two key components in a communication model, and the interaction between them is typically structured in a layered approach. 

 Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers.Client and Servers?

            The TCP/IP model is the foundational protocol suite that underpins the majority of modern internet communications. The TCP/IP model simplifies and standardizes the networking process by providing a set of protocols for devices to communicate over a network.

    Overview of the TCP/IP Model
         The TCP/IP model consists of 4 layers:

        - Application Layer
        - Transport Layer
        - Internet Layer
        - Link Layer

     1. Application Layer

        Function: 
            The topmost layer is responsible for providing network services directly to end-user applications.

        Role in Client-Server Communication:

        Client Side: 
            The client sends a request to the server using an application protocol (e.g., a web browser using HTTP to request a webpage).

        Server Side:
            The server receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response (e.g., the server sends a web page back to the client).

    2. Transport Layer

        Function:
            This layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication between two devices. It manages flow control, error detection, and correction, and provides either reliable or unreliable data delivery.

        Role in Client-Server Communication:

        Client Side: 
            The client uses a transport protocol to ensure that its requests are reliably delivered to the server. If using TCP, it ensures the data is reliably transmitted (through mechanisms like retransmission, acknowledgments, etc.).

        Server Side: 
            The server listens for incoming data from clients on specific ports and responds accordingly. For reliable transmission, the server uses TCP or other transport protocols to send responses.

    3. Internet Layer

        Function:
             This layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and forwarding packets across networks. 

        Role in Client-Server Communication:

        Client Side:
            The client packages its data into packets and addresses them using the destination IP address (of the server). The packet is then passed to the network to be routed to the correct server.

        Server Side: 
            The server receives the data packet at its network interface, extracts the destination IP, and processes the packet accordingly. It sends a response packet back to the client using the reverse routing process.

    4. Link Layer

        Function:
            The link layer (sometimes referred to as the Network Interface Layer) is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a network medium, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or fiber optics.

    Role in Client-Server Communication:

        Client Side: 
            The client prepares the data for transmission over the physical medium (e.g., sending data packets through an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi).
        
        Server Side: 
            The server receives data frames from the link layer, decodes them, and passes them to the higher layers (such as the Internet and Transport layers).
 
    TCP/IP Model - Client vs. Server Interaction

        Client:

           - Initiates communication (requests data or services).
           - Sends data to a specific server using the Application and Transport layers.
           - Receives data or responses from the server.

        Server:

           - Waits for incoming communication (e.g., HTTP requests).
           - Processes the request at the Application Layer and prepares a response.
           - Sends the response through the layers back to the client.
