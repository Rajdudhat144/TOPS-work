Create a case study on the functionality of the presentation, business logic, and data access layers of a given software system.


        Case Study: E-Commerce Web Application
        Introduction:

        In this case study, we explore the functionality of the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer in a typical e-commerce web application. This e-commerce platform allows customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and make purchases. The system also supports admin functionalities like managing products, viewing orders, and updating inventory.

        1. Presentation Layer (User Interface)
        Functionality:

        The Presentation Layer serves as the interface between the user (customer or admin) and the underlying business logic of the e-commerce platform. It is responsible for presenting the information to the user and collecting user input. This layer does not process any business rules but serves as the entry point for user interactions.

        Components:

        Web Interface: The e-commerce site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for the frontend), and the web page is responsive for different devices (mobile, desktop).
        User Interaction: Customers interact with the platform via forms, buttons, search bars, and filters. Common actions include browsing products, adding items to the shopping cart, checking out, and viewing order history.
        API Integration: The frontend communicates with the Business Logic Layer via RESTful APIs (such as GET /products, POST /cart, POST /order).
        Security: Basic user authentication (login/logout), session management, and input validation are handled at this layer.
        Example Scenario:

        A user visits the website and sees a list of products.
        They filter products by category (e.g., electronics, clothes) or price range.
        They click on a product to see details, including price, description, and available stock.

        2. Business Logic Layer (Application Layer)
            Functionality:

            The Business Logic Layer (BLL) is the core of the application. It processes user inputs, applies business rules, and handles the system’s operations. This layer interacts with the Presentation Layer to accept user inputs and with the Data Access Layer to retrieve and store data.

            Components:

            Application Logic: The core logic is implemented in the backend using a server-side technology such as Node.js, Django (Python), or Spring Boot (Java). This includes business rules such as calculating prices, managing inventory, handling user authentication, and processing orders.
            API Endpoints: RESTful APIs expose application functionality to the frontend. Common APIs include POST /cart/add, POST /order/create, GET /user/orders, etc.
            Session Management: The application ensures that users' sessions are maintained during their interaction, allowing them to add multiple items to the cart, login/logout, and navigate across different pages without losing state.
            Validation & Security: Input validation, encryption, and authorization checks (e.g., ensuring the user has permission to place an order) are performed here.
            Example Scenario:

            Add to Cart:

            The user adds an item to the cart. The frontend sends a POST /cart/add request with product details (product ID and quantity) to the backend.
            The Business Logic Layer processes this request by:
            Verifying that the product exists in the database.
            Ensuring that the requested quantity is available in stock.
            Adding the product to the user’s session cart.
            Calculating the updated total price of the cart.
            The backend then sends a response to the frontend confirming the product has been added to the cart.
            Order Creation:

            When the user proceeds to checkout, the frontend sends a POST /order/create request with the user's cart details, shipping address, and payment information.
            The backend verifies the payment information (using a payment gateway API).
            It then checks if the products in the cart are still available in stock, deducts the purchased quantities from the inventory, and creates a new order entry in the database.
            The Business Logic Layer sends back a confirmation response to the frontend, which displays the order summary and confirmation to the user.
           
            3. Data Access Layer (Database Layer)
            Functionality:

            The Data Access Layer (DAL) is responsible for the persistent storage and retrieval of data. It directly interacts with the database and abstracts the details of the data storage from the business logic.

            Components:

            Database: A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) is used to store data such as products, users, orders, inventory, etc.
            ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Frameworks such as Sequelize (Node.js), Hibernate (Java), or Django ORM (Python) abstract SQL queries and allow the backend to interact with the database through objects rather than raw SQL.
            Data Retrieval and Updates: The data access layer provides services such as fetching product information (SELECT * FROM products), updating inventory after an order is placed, or storing user details (INSERT INTO users).
            Caching: Data that is frequently accessed (e.g., product listings, user session data) can be cached using a caching system like Redis to improve performance and reduce database load.
            Example Scenario:

            Fetching Product Information:

            When a user visits the product catalog, the frontend sends a request (GET /products).
            The Business Logic Layer calls the Data Access Layer to fetch the list of products from the database. This query might look like:
            sql
            
            UPDATE products SET stock = stock - ? WHERE product_id = ?;
            All database queries are encapsulated in the Data Access Layer, ensuring that the application does not directly expose its database logic to the business layer.
            Interactions Between Layers
            Presentation Layer: User interaction triggers API calls (e.g., adding items to cart, checking out).
            Business Logic Layer: Processes requests (e.g., validates inputs, calculates totals, interacts with payment gateways) and retrieves or stores data through the Data Access Layer.
            Data Access Layer: Interacts with the database, retrieves and stores data, and returns results to the Business Logic Layer.
           
            Example Flow: User Checkout Process
            The user adds items to their cart and proceeds to checkout.
            The frontend sends a POST /order/create request with the order details (cart items, user details, payment info).
            The backend validates the user’s information and checks product availability (Business Logic Layer).
            The backend calls the Data Access Layer to check product stock and create a new order.
            If products are available, the Data Access Layer updates the inventory and stores the order in the database.
            The Business Logic Layer sends a confirmation response (success or failure) to the Presentation Layer.
            The frontend displays the order confirmation to the user.
            Conclusion
            In this e-commerce case study, we have explored how each layer functions and interacts in a Three-Tier Architecture:

            Presentation Layer handles the user interface and interaction.
            Business Logic Layer implements the application’s business rules, including validation, session management, and API integrations.
            Data Access Layer manages persistent data, including querying, updating, and storing data in a database.
