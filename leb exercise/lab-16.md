            Types of Application Software and Their Impact on Productivity
            Productivity Software:

            Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) improve document creation with features like spell check and templates.
            Spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel) automate calculations and data analysis, enhancing efficiency.
            Presentation Software (e.g., PowerPoint) simplifies creating and presenting visual content.
            Email & Calendar (e.g., Outlook, Google Calendar) streamline communication and scheduling.
            Creative Software:

            Graphic Design (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) speeds up visual content creation with advanced editing tools.
            Video Editing (e.g., Adobe Premiere) simplifies video production through editing tools and effects.
            Database Management Software (DBMS):

            DBMS (e.g., MySQL) stores and retrieves large datasets efficiently, improving data accessibility and reporting.
            Enterprise Software:

            CRM (e.g., Salesforce) and ERP (e.g., SAP) integrate business processes, automate workflows, and provide real-time data for decision-making.
            Collaboration Software:

            Project Management (e.g., Trello, Slack) helps teams organize tasks, communicate, and track progress.
            How Application Software Improves Productivity:
            Automation: Reduces manual tasks (e.g., auto-calculations in spreadsheets).
            Time-Saving: Templates and tools speed up work processes.
            Accuracy: Reduces human error with automated checks.
            Collaboration: Facilitates real-time teamwork and communication.
            Data-Driven Decisions: Provides insights through analytics and reporting
