            Basic System Architecture for a Food Delivery App
            The system architecture of a food delivery app can be divided into several key components:

            Client Layer (Mobile App/Web):
            Users interact with the app to browse restaurants, place orders, make payments, and track deliveries.
            Can be an iOS/Android mobile app or a web interface.
            
            API Layer:
            A RESTful API that connects the client with the backend services.
            Handles user authentication, orders, payment processing, and data retrieval.
            
            Backend Layer:
            Order Management: Manages order processing, updates, and delivery status.
            Restaurant Management: Manages restaurant details, menu, and availability.
            User Management: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
            Payment Gateway: Manages secure payment processing (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
            Delivery Management: Manages delivery drivers and tracks delivery status.
            
            Database Layer:
            Relational Database (SQL): Stores structured data like user profiles, orders, restaurants, etc.
            NoSQL Database: Stores unstructured data like reviews, tracking info, etc.
            Caching (e.g., Redis): Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.
            
            Third-Party Integrations:
            Payment Gateway: For secure transactions.
            Map Service (Google Maps): For delivery tracking and route optimization.
            Notification Service: For sending real-time updates (e.g., Firebase, Twilio).
            Key Components Interaction:
            User Interface communicates with the API Layer, which interacts with the Backend (Order, User, Restaurant Management) and the Database.
            Payment Gateway handles transactions, and Map Service provides route details.
            Real-time Notifications are sent to users regarding order status updates.
