Identify and classify 5 applications you use daily as either system software or application software?

                    Applications can be broadly classified into system software and application software based on their primary function. Here's a classification of 5 common applications that people use daily:

        1. Google Chrome (Web Browser)
            Classification: Application Software
                    Explanation: Google Chrome is a web browser used to access the internet. It is designed to allow users to browse websites, watch videos, use web apps, etc. It does not perform fundamental tasks related to the operation of the computer's hardware or manage system resources, so it's categorized as application software.

        2. Microsoft Windows (Operating System)
            Classification: System Software
                    Explanation: Microsoft Windows is an operating system that manages hardware and software resources on a computer. It provides a user interface, controls input/output devices, manages memory, and handles processes. Since it operates at the core of the system and is responsible for controlling the system's hardware, it is classified as system software.

        3. Spotify (Music Streaming Service)
            Classification: Application Software
                    Explanation: Spotify is an application software that allows users to stream music, create playlists, and access a variety of audio content. It doesn't control the hardware or manage system resources; it operates on top of an operating system to provide a specific user service, which classifies it as application software.

        4. Adobe Photoshop (Image Editing Software)
            Classification: Application Software
                    Explanation: Adobe Photoshop is a powerful image editing program used for graphic design, photo editing, and digital art. It is designed for specific tasks and does not perform system-level functions, making it a clear example of application software.

        5. Antivirus Software (e.g., Norton, McAfee)
            Classification: System Software
                    Explanation: Antivirus software is considered system software because it works directly with the operating system to protect the system from malicious software (malware), scans files, and ensures the safety of the system's operations. It manages security functions at a fundamental level, similar to system utilities, and operates in the background to protect system resources.
