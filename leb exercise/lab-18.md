            Requirement Specification for a Simple Library Management System

            1. Introduction
            A Library Management System (LMS) that helps manage books, users, and transactions (borrowing and returning books) efficiently. It aims to simplify the management of library resources.

            2. Functional Requirements
            User Management: Add, edit, delete, and view users. Track user borrowing history.
            Book Management: Add, edit, delete, and view books (title, author, ISBN, etc.).
            Transaction Management: Lend and return books, track due dates, and manage overdue fines.
            Search Functionality: Search books by title, author, ISBN, and genre.
            Reports: Generate overdue reports, available books, and user borrowing history.

            3. Non-Functional Requirements
            Usability: Easy-to-use interface for librarians and users.
            Performance: Fast search (under 2 seconds) and support for 500 concurrent users.
            Security: User authentication, encrypted data, and logging of actions.
            Scalability: Supports future growth in users, books, and transactions.

            4. Interface Requirements
            User Interface (UI): Dashboard for librarians, search bar, user profile page, and transaction history.
            System Interface: Backend database (MySQL) and integration with external notification services (e.g., email/SMS for due date reminders).

            5. Assumptions and Constraints
            The system is web-based, using a MySQL database.
            Users need valid library membership to borrow books.
            It does not support advanced features like eBook management or multi-library support.
