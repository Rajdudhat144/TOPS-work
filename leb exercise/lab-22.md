            Case Study: Critical Maintenance for Healthcare Management System
            Background
            A healthcare provider used a legacy Healthcare Management System (HMS) for patient data, billing, and scheduling. Over time, the system experienced security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and non-compliance with updated regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

            Issues Identified
            Security Vulnerabilities: Outdated encryption and weak access control exposed sensitive patient data.
            System Downtime: Performance bottlenecks caused frequent downtime, especially during peak hours.
            Compliance Risks: The system didnâ€™t meet recent HIPAA and GDPR standards.
            Integration Problems: The HMS struggled to integrate with newer telemedicine and payment systems.
            Maintenance Actions
            Security Updates: Upgraded encryption (AES-256), added multi-factor authentication (MFA), and enhanced access controls.
            Performance Improvements: Optimized the database, added load balancing, and implemented real-time monitoring.
            Compliance: Updated the system for HIPAA and GDPR compliance, including better data encryption and audit logs.
            System Integration: Integrated telemedicine platforms and modern payment gateways.
            Results
            Improved Security: Patched vulnerabilities, ensuring patient data protection.
            Enhanced Performance: Reduced downtime and improved transaction speed.
            Regulatory Compliance: Met HIPAA and GDPR standards.
            System Integration: Enabled remote healthcare services and modern payment processing.
